# Towards Objective Heart Disease Classification: A Deep Neural Network Approach for Comprehensive Diagnosis

This is official repository of the paper "Towards Objective Heart Disease Classification: A Deep Neural Network Approach for Comprehensive Diagnosis".
The paper deals with a methodology for heart disease classification exploiting image processing by echocardiography.
We pursued a more objective heart disease classification by comparing the performance of different deep learning-based models with a high-quality dataset containing multiple heart diseases and views.
